# DfT examples on croc SoC

This repository provides a series of examples of for DfT insertion using Tessent tools. In order to illustrate the usage of the DfT flow, this repository used the [croc SoC](https://github.com/pulp-platform/croc). The examples are implmented using the IHP130nm PDK to make the flow more realistic. 

Currently, the repository provides three initial examples, however the repository is going to be continously updated with additional examples and study cases. The following is the list of the examples. 

- [1.croc_soc_mbist_edt_flat](./1.croc_soc_mbist_edt_flat/): This example demostrates the DfT insertion of MBIST and EDT on the flatten version of the croc SoC.

- [2.croc_soc_mbist_tk_lbist_flat](./2.croc_soc_mbist_tk_lbist_flat/): This example demostrates the insertion of both MBIST and LBIST on the flatten version of the Croc SoC.

- [3.croc_soc-mbist-tk_lbist_hier](./3.croc_soc-mbist-tk_lbist_hier/): This example shows a hierarchical DfT insertion of MBIST and Hybrid TK/LBIST on the Croc SoC. This also includes de usage of single chain mode for testing the DfT instruments as well.
